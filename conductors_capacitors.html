    <h1 class="unit-title">Conductors</h1>
    <p class="content">
      A <em>conductor</em> is a special type of material which allows electrons
      to move freely. This means that electricity can easily flow through them.
      Most metals make great conductors such as copper, aluminum, and iron.
      There are several electrostatic properties of all conductors.
    </p>
    <li class="content">
      The net E-field inside of a conductor is always zero.
    </li>
    <li class="content">
      Any net charge of a conductor accumulates on its surface.
    </li>
    <li class="content">
      The electric potential at any point of the conductor is the same. In other
      words, the entire conductor is in equipotential.
    </li>
    <li class="content">
      The E-field produced by a conductor is always perpendicular to the surface
      of the conductor.
    </li>
    <p class="content">
      Let's explore each of these properties in more detail.
    </p>

    <h2 class="content">
      "The net E-field inside of a conductor is always zero."
    </h2>
    <p class="content">
      When a conductor is placed in an E-field, the net E-field inside of that
      conductor is always zero. This is because when the conductor is placed in
      an E-field, the positive charges are going to be pushed to the surface
      furthest from the source of the E-field, while the electrons are going to
      be pulled to the surface closest to the source of the E-field. When this
      happens, the conductor becomes polarized. These polarized charges then
      create an equal and opposite E-field inside of the conductor which thus
      cancels out the original E-field.

    </h2>
    <p class="content">
      Recall that one of the main defining characteristics of a conductor is
      that it enables charge to move freely inside of it. Consider a simple
      example for understanding. If a conductor has some positive charge Q, the
      protons inside of the conductor will repel each other and will want to be
      as far apart from each other as possible. The only way to achieve this is
      to reside on the surface of the conductor.

        Protons inside of the positively charged spherical conductor repel each
        other to be furthest away from possible. This causes them to reside on
        the sphere's surface.

    <h2 class="content">"The entire conductor is in equipotential."</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Potential differences cause charges to move. If there were potential
      differences within a conductor, because charges are allowed to move
      freely, they would simply move until the conductor was in equipotential.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2 class="content">
      "The E-field produced by a conductor is always perpendicular to the
      surface of the conductor."
    </h2>
    <p class="content">
      The simplest way to explain why the E-field is always perpendicular to the
      surface of the conductor is this: Any components of the E-field parallel
      to the surface will cause a movement of charges, rearranging the charges
      in such a way that breaks the first and third properties of conductors.
      Perpendicular E-field components, however, will not cause the movement of
      charge because the charges have nowhere to go since they are bounded by
      the surface or the repulsive force from the opposite side.
    </p>

    <h2 class="content">Capacitors</h2>
    <p class="content">
      A <em>capacitor</em> is an electrical component used to store charge and
      consists of two conductors held a fixed distance away from eachother. The
      most common form of a capacitor is one made of two parallel plates.
      <br />
      <br />
      When a capacitor stands alone, it is nothing more than two conductors
      considered together as a system - before current runs through a capacitor
      thus giving it charge, the capacitor acts as a
      <em>wire.</em> This fact will be incredibly useful during circuit analysis
      later on. However, as soon as a capacitor is hooked up to a battery (the
      positive end of the battery wired to one plate and the negative end wired
      to other), charge is forced onto one of the plates. This gives the first
      plate a positive charge. The positive charge on this first plate then
      repels the positive charge out of the second plate, leaving it with a
      negative charge of equal magnitude.

    <br />
    <br />
    <p class="content">
      Once current has run through the capacitor for an appropriate amount of
      time, the capcaitor becomes fully charged. Both plates will have an equal
      and opposite charge, and no more charge can be forced through the
      capacitor. When a capacitor is fully charged, it acts like a
      <em>broken wire.</em> Again, this will be useful for circuit analysis
      later.

      <h5>A fully charged capacitor will act as a broken wire.</h5>
    </center>
    <p class="content">
      In the above figure, the capacitor is fully charged and no more current
      runs through it. There is a potential difference between the two plates as
      well as an E-field which is how energy is stored. Once a capictor is fully
      charged, it itself can now act as a temporary battery. If the voltage
      source (initial battery) is removed from the capacitor, a fixed potential
      difference is no longer being held across the plates. Instead, the charge
      will begin to flow until the capacitor runs out of charge and reverts to
      its original state.
      <br />
      <br />
      The space between the two plates in a capacitor is technically air.
      However, it does not have to be. This space can also be filled by a
      material known as a <em>dielectric.</em> A dielectric is just another word
      for an insulator - the electrons cannot physically flow from plate to
      plate through the dielectric. All dielectrics have a dielectric constant,
      &#922;.The dielectric constant of a material is a measure of how much
      energy it is capable of storing.
      <br />
      <br />
      The capacitance, C, can be determined by
      <center><p>C=(&#922;&#949;<sub>o</sub>A)/d</p></center>
      <p class="content">where &#949; is the <em>permitivity of free space</em>  and is a constant. The unit of capacitance is the Farad, F. When the dielectric is air, &#922;=1 and the capacitance becomes</p>
      <center><p>C=(&#949;<sub>o</sub>A)/d</p></center>

      <p class="content">These are some other equations that pertain to capacitors:</p>
      <center><p>Q=CV <em>the charge stored on the capacitor</em></p></center>
      <center><p>C=Q/V <em>the capacitance in terms of its charge and the potential difference between the two plates</em></p></center>
      <center><p>U=(QV)/2=(CV<sup>2</sup>)/2 <em>the electric potential energy stored</em></p></center>
      <br>
      <br>

      <p class="content">If capacitors are placed in parallel within a circuit, the total capacitance of the circuit is simply the sum of the individual capacitances.  </p>
      <center><p>C=C<sub>1</sub>+C<sub>2</sub>+...</p></center>
      <p class="content">However, capacitors placed in series will have a total capacitance of</p>
