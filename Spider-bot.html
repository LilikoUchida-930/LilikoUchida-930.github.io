      <p class="project-description">
        As part of my Intro to Robotics course, we were tasked with the
        objective of creating a robot which could get from Floor 1 to Floor 2 of
        our engineering building. While many teams designed their robot to take
        the elevator, we wanted to take a different approach. My team and I
        decided to commit to a very ambitious design: a robot which could climb
        the walls to get to the second floor. <br /><br />There were two most
        critical modules governing this idea:
      
      <br />

      <ol>
        <li>
          Getting the robot to lift itself vertically so that its bottom lies
          against the wall.
        </li>
        <li>
          Creating a drone suction between the robot and the wall so it remains
          stuck while the wheels navigate it along the wall.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <p class="project-description">In order to align the robot vertically with the wall, we selected wheels and motors with enough torque and friction such that they could lift the body up against the wall upon approach. Electronic speed controllers were used for the drone motors, and the robot was driven wirelessly via Arduino. <br><br>Unfortunately, our robot was could not be fully functional by the deadline. However, this project served as a great opportunity to try something outsde of the box and freely fail at the expense of the ability to be creative and attempt something brand new.</p>
