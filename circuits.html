    <h1 class="unit-title">Introduction Circuits & Loads</h1>
    <p class="content">
      One of the ultimate purposes of studying electricity and charge is to be
      able to understand electric circuits. An <em>electrical circuit</em> is a
      network of electrical components and are responsible for the functionality
      of all digital technology. Every circuit must have a source of power
      (often a battery), wires to allow the flow of charge, one or more loads
      (capacitors, resistors, inductors), and an output. Circuits rely on moving
      charge to function. This moving charge is known as <em>current.</em> More
      specifically, current is a rate of the flow of charge through a specific
      point in a circuit. The unit for current is the ampere, A.

    <p class="content">
      Current is induced when a voltage is present.
      <em>Current density, J,</em> is a measure of current flowing through a
      designated cross sectional area.

    <!-- Resistors -->
    <h2 class="content">Resistors</h2>
    <p class="content">
      <em>Resistors</em> are the simplest type of electrical load and are used
      to control the current through a circuit. Think of a resistor as a piece
      of sponge stuck inside of a hose. Water will still flow through the hose,
      but the flow will slow down at the sponge, and the pressure difference
      will be larger for a thicker sponge than for a thinner one. Basically, a
      resistor <em>resists</em> the flow of charge.

    <p class="content">
      This relationship between voltage, current, and resistence is known as
      <em>Ohm's Law.</em>
      For resistors in series, the total resistance is simply equal to the sum
      of the individual resistances.

    <p class="content">
      R<sub>eq</sub> is the equivalent resistance, or the total resistance of
      the circuit. Resistors in parallel sum differently. For resistors in
      parallel, there resistance combined becomes

    <!-- Capacitors -->
    <h2 class="content">Capacitors</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Capacitors were discussed more in detail
      <a href="/conductors_capacitors.html" target="_blank">here.</a> In brief
      summary though, capacitors store charge. When they are uncharged, they
      behave as a wire and can short a circuit. However, once they are fully
      charged, current can no longer run through them and they behave as a
      broken wire. The equations for capacitors are as follows:
    </p>
    <center>
      <p>C=(&#922;&#949;<sub>o</sub>A)/d if there is a dielectric</p>
    </center>
    <center><p>C=(&#949;<sub>o</sub>A)/d if there is only air</p></center>
    <center>
      <p>Q=CV</p>
    </center>
    <center>
      <p>C=Q/V</p>
    </center>
    <center>
      <p>U=(QV)/2=(CV<sup>2</sup>)/2</p>
    </center>
    <center>
      <p>C=C<sub>1</sub>+C<sub>2</sub>+... for capacitors in parallel</p>
    </center>

    <center>
      <p>
        1/C<sub>total</sub>=1/C<sub>1</sub>+1/C<sub>2</sub>+... for capacitors
        in series
      </p>
    </center>
    <p class="content">
      Like resistors, if a circuit includes some capacitors in series and some
      in parallel, the equivalent capacitance can be found simply by adding the
      equivalent capacitances of each occurence.

      An <em>inductor</em> is just a wire looped around a tube and is
      responsible for opposing changes in current.

    conductors will be discussed in a later section after magnetism, since
    inductors rely heavily on that topic. For now, know that all inductors have
    an inductance L, and the voltage drop at an inductor in a circuit is

  <!-- Analyzing circuits -->
  <h2 class="content">Analyzing electric circuits</h2>
  <p class="content">
    The easiest way to understand how to analyze a circuit is to use a water
    flow analogy. Consider a single pipe of uniform cross section with some
    water flowing through it at a constant flow rate. The flow rate at one point
    of that pipe will be equal to the flow rate at any other point within that
    pipe. Now, imagine that this pipe suddenly breaks off into two pipes like a
    fork in the road. One of these pipes which branch off from the main one is
    much narrower than the other. So, the water flow which first starts in the
    main pipe will break off into the two branches at different amounts. The
    total amount of flow through the branched pipes is equal to the total flow
    before the water split at the node.

    <h5>Water flowing through a pipe</h5>
  </center>

  <p class="content">
    In this analogy, the water flow is the current, the point at which the
    larger pipe breaks off into two smaller pipes is the node, and the different
    sizes of the smaller pipes which therefore affect the flow of water through
    them represents an electric load of varying magnitude. In the next section,
    we will discuss more on how to analyze an electrical circuit and do several
    examples.
