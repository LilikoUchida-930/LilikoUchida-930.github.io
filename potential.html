  <h1 class="unit-title">Electric Potential</h1>
  <h2 class="unit-title">Electric potential energy</h2>
  <p class="content">
    Much like in mechanics, atoms can also have kinetic and potential energies.
    When an atom is held in place inside of an E-field, it has a certain
    potential energy - meaning, if it is let go, it will accelerate and gain
    some kinetic energy (converted from the potential energy the atom stored in
    its static state) as it moves away or towards the E-field source.
    Conservation is applied to electric charges just as it is to physical
    objects in mechanics!
    <br />
    <br />
    Consider the following example. Two equal and oppositely charged plates
    create an E-field from left to right. Assume that atoms at points 1 and 2
    are both positively charged and of the same magnitude. The atom at point 1
    has more potential energy than that at point 2 because it is closer to the
    positively charged plate, meaning there is a stronger repulsive force
    between it and the plate. If both atoms are released, the atom at point 1
    will accelerate at a much greater rate.

      Two positively charged atoms placed in the same E-field but at different
      locations will have different electric potential energies.

    It is important to differentiate work done by the E-field vs. work done by
    an external force. The work done by the electric field is positive when the
    atom loses electric potential energy and gains kinetic energy. Conversely,
    the work done by an external force (think a hand pushing a positively
    charged atom forcefully towards another positively charged atom) is positive
    if the electric potential energy is increasing and negative if the kinetic
    energy increases. This concept can better be shown through the following
    equations:

      W<sub>E-field</sub>=-U<sub>electric</sub>=(kq<sub>1</sub>q<sub>2</sub>)/r
    </p>
    <p>W<sub>external</sub>=U<sub>electric</sub></p>
    <p>KE=W<sub>E-field</sub></p>

  <h2 class="unit-title">Electric potential</h2>
  <p class="content">
    It is important to understand the distinction between electric potential
    energy vs. electric potential, or <em>voltage.</em> While electric potential
    energy is in units of Joules, the units of voltage is Joules per Coulomb
    [J/C], or the volt [V]. The electric potential at some point P a distance r
    away from the source charge Q is calculated as

    The electric potential difference between two points P1 and P2 can also be
    related to the E-field as
