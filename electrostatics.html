    <!-- Introduction -->
    <h1 class="unit-title">Electrostatics</h1>
    <p class="content">
      <em>Electrostatics</em> is the study of stationary electric charges and
      their behavior. <em>Charge</em> is a
      property, and objects can be negatively or positively charged. More protons than electrons will yield a positive net charge, while more electrons than protons will yield a negative net charge. If there is no net charge, the subject is neutral. Both electrons
      and protons have equal and opposite elementary charges of &plusmn
      1.602E-19 Coulombs. Like charges repel while opposites attract.

    <p class="content">
      Since charges can repel or attract one another, that means that they must
      experience some force. <em>Coulomb's Law</em> gives the magnitude of force
      between two particle charges:

        <p>F<sub>e</sub>=(kq<sub>1</sub>q<sub>2</sub>)/d<sup>2</sup></p>

    </p>

    <!-- Polarization -->
    <h2 class="unit-title">Polarization</h2>
    <p class="content">
      <em>Polarization</em> is the phenomena that occurs when positive and
      negative charges are separated to opposite sides of a single object.
      Consider the following example:
      <br />
      <br />
      A positively charged rod is brought near a neutral sphere. Since the rod
      is positively charged, it has an excess of protons. These protons will
      attract the electrons inside of the neutral sphere towards the side of the
      sphere closer to the rod. Simultaneously, the excess protons in the rod
      will repel the protons in the sphere to the furthest side of the sphere.
      The sphere is now said to be polarized because all of the protons reside
      on one side of the sphere while all of the electrons reside on the other.
      Polarization is the key to electrical induction which will be discussed
      next.

    <!-- Induction -->
    <h2 class="unit-title">Induction</h2>
    <p class="content">
      <em>Electrical induction</em> is a method in which a neutral object is given charge. It is best explained by the graphic below.

    <br />

    <p class="content">
      Electrical induction only works for a special class of materials known as
      <em>conductors.</em> Electrons can move freely in conductors while they
      cannot in insulators. This is why electricity cannot move through
      materials such as plastic or rubber, both which are insulators. On the
      other hand, electricity can pass very well through metals like copper,
      which is a conductor.
