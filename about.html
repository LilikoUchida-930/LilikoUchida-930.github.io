        The most common question I get is this: <b>"Did I misspell your name?"</b> 
        <br>
        <br> 
        My name is, on paper, spelled 'Ririko' due to Japanese phonetics. However, to reflect its true pronounciation and to avoid the repeated effort it takes to explain this, I choose to spell my name <em>Liliko</em> for all things not legally binding. 
        <br> 
        <br> 
        I have been based in Massachusetts for 24 years, and before my commitment to engineering, my life was heavily saturated with music and sports. I spent many years playing jazz, running cross-country and track, and writing music. It was this variety in my day-to-day life which drew me in closer to the sciences of physics and engineering. In my mind, they were the only two disciplines which could truly cast such a wide net on everything that I loved and serve as a stable foundation of understanding what made them so interesting and how.
        <br>
        <br>
        Traveling is a very valuable part of my life, and I have been on several trips which have shaped me in ways I could have never imaged. Most recently, I travelled to Uganda in November of 2023 with 9 other coworkers from my company. Together, we partnered with Women in Technology Uganda to work with hundreds of girls on nurturing their programming, engineering, and leadership skills. This trip was one of the most special opportunities which I hold very close to me. It brought upon friendships unlike any other and perspectives on technology in different parts of the world otherwise impossible to truly internalize.
