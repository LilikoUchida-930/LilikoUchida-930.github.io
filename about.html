      <p id="bio-long">
        My name is Liliko Uchida (legally spelled "Ririko" due to Japanese
        phonetics). I grew up in Northborough Massachusetts, where music,
        singing, cross country, and track consumed a large portion of my life.
        During my second half of high-school, I fell in love with physics and
        knew I wanted to carry that passion along with my constant desire for a
        creative outlet to college with me. Based on this, I decided to go to
        school for mechanical engineering.<br /><br />At Tufts, one of my
        largest engagements has been working with the Student Accessibility and
        Academic Resources (StAAR) Center as a subject tutor. I love to help
        others learn. Particularly, I have made a personal commitment to give
        back to the physics community as I have benefitted greatly from the
        generosity of peers and incredibly motivating and inspiring mentors.
        <br /><br />I love to experience various creative outlets during my free
        time including design (which recently sparked my interest in learning
        some web development on the side), music (check out my music page!), and
        writing. I also admire the outdoors, and have included some photos on
        this page of favorite places I've been too!
